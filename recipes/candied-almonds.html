    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>

     <li>2 cups raw almonds</li>   
     <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li> 
     <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li> 
     <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li> 
     <li>1/4 cup water</li> 
     <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set it aside.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, combine the sugar, salt, cinnamon, and water. Stir until the sugar dissolves.</li>
    <li>Add the almonds to the pan and stir continuously to coat them with the sugar mixture.</li>
    <li>Continue stirring for about 8-10 minutes, until the sugar thickens and starts to crystallize around the almonds.</li>
    <li>Once the sugar fully coats the almonds and turns golden brown, remove the pan from the heat.</li>
    <li>Stir in the vanilla extract quickly and mix well.</li>
    <li>Immediately transfer the almonds to the prepared baking sheet, spreading them out evenly to prevent clumping.</li>
    <li>Let them cool completely before breaking apart any stuck-together pieces.</li>
    <li>Store in an airtight container and enjoy!</li>
